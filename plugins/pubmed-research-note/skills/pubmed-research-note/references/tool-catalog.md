# Source Tool Catalog

Read before your first tool call. Four engines, four jobs. Each has an **MCP path**
(preferred; this plugin declares PubMed and Clinical Trials in its own `.mcp.json`) and a
**web fallback**. A missing server never blocks the run — except PubMed, whose absence is
fatal and must be stated rather than worked around.

Server prefixes for managed connectors are **hashes** and change between sessions. Never
hardcode. Resolve at runtime with `ToolSearch` / `tool_search`.

## 1. PubMed — the backbone

```
ToolSearch  query: "select:search_articles,get_article_metadata,get_full_text_article,find_related_articles,convert_article_ids,lookup_article_by_citation"
```

| Tool | Use | Key args |
|------|-----|----------|
| `search_articles` | Find papers. The workhorse. | `query` (field tags `[Title]`, `[Author]`, `[MeSH Terms]`, `[Publication Type]`, boolean AND/OR/NOT), `max_results`, `sort` (`relevance` / `pub_date`), `date_from` / `date_to`. No `*` wildcards, no empty query. |
| `get_article_metadata` | Full record — **capture PMID, title, journal, year, DOI**. | `pmids: ["...", "..."]` |
| `get_full_text_article` | PMC full text (~6M articles). Use for the 2–3 papers the verdict actually hinges on. | `pmc_ids: ["PMC..."]` |
| `find_related_articles` | Close gaps; find full-text availability. | `pmids`, `link_type` |
| `convert_article_ids` | PMID ↔ PMCID ↔ DOI. | ids |
| `lookup_article_by_citation` | Resolve a half-remembered citation. | citation fields |

**High-evidence recipe** (the backbone query):
```
<topic> AND (Guideline[Publication Type] OR Meta-Analysis[Publication Type]
  OR systematic[sb] OR Randomized Controlled Trial[Publication Type])
```
Widen only if thin. Then run **one deliberately adversarial query** — search for the
negative or null result explicitly (`AND (negative OR null OR "failed to")`, or search the
known large trial by name). A verdict built only from the positive literature is the
publication bias, restated.

**Web fallback.** WebSearch `pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov`, WebFetch the article page, capture
PMID + DOI (both printed). Or E-utilities:
`https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=<query>&retmode=json`
then `efetch.fcgi?db=pubmed&id=<pmid>&rettype=abstract`.

**Scope guard.** PubMed indexes biomedical/life-sciences only. Never source a clinical claim
from a blog. If PubMed is unreachable entirely, say so and stop — do not downgrade the
evidence base and proceed.

## 2. ClinicalTrials.gov — the publication-bias check

**Mandatory for the Rx and Service frames.** Its only job: *what evidence exists that is
not in the published record, and would it change the verdict?*

```
ToolSearch  query: "select:search_trials,get_trial_details,search_by_sponsor,analyze_endpoints,search_by_eligibility"
```

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| `search_trials` | Trials on the intervention. Filter by status. |
| `get_trial_details` | Full record for one `NCT` — design, n, endpoints, dates, results-posted flag. |
| `analyze_endpoints` | Primary vs secondary outcome measures — catches endpoint-switching. |
| `search_by_sponsor` | Industry-sponsored terminated trials. A cluster of them is a finding. |
| `search_by_eligibility` | Does the trial population resemble the patient in front of you? |

**Three things to look for, in this order:**

1. **Completed, no publication.** Completion date > 2 years ago, no linked results, nothing
   in PubMed. This is the single most common reason a confident positive verdict is wrong.
2. **Ongoing, large, reading out soon.** Belongs in `## What would change this`, with the
   expected readout date. For a Service decision this can be the whole answer — *wait*.
3. **Terminated / withdrawn, and why.** Slow accrual is noise. Futility or safety is signal.

**Web fallback.** WebFetch `https://clinicaltrials.gov/api/v2/studies?query.term=<term>`.

Report every NCT you cite in `## Sources` as `NCT NNNNNNNN — status, n, endpoint, readout`.

---

## 3. Open Library — the textbook-vs-evidence gap

**Mandatory for the Teaching frame.** Optional elsewhere. Its job is not to source a
clinical claim — it is to establish *what the trainee has been taught*, so the report can
name where the canon and the evidence diverge.

MCP prefix `mcp__open-library__<tool>`: `get_book_by_title`, `get_authors_by_name`,
`get_author_info`, `get_book_by_id`.

**Web fallback.** WebFetch `https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title=<title>` — read
edition, OLID, ISBN from the JSON.

A textbook citation without an **edition** is not a citation. Kaplan & Sadock 11e and 12e
disagree about things.

---

## 4. Wikipedia — terminology only

Resolve synonyms, brand names, scale full-names, abbreviations. That is the entire remit.

**It is barred from shaping the report outline.** Do not read its section list. Do not
derive sub-questions from it. Never cite it. If a term is unambiguous, skip it entirely —
this engine is optional on every run.

Its historical role in this skill (generating 3–6 sub-questions that became the report's
H2 headings) is the specific defect this version exists to remove.
